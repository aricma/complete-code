## SOLID
The SOLID Principles are:
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Injection Principle
## KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid
## DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself 
## YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It

## ETC - Easy To Change
A term I picked up from ["The Pragmatic Programmer"](Book%20Tips). ETC is described by the authors as a value that can help you decide to pick the best solution for your problem.
In software we always aim for the solution that is easy to change. If we can not change it later it is no longer software but hardware.
How do you know if something is easy to change? Try to change it and see if it is easy.
