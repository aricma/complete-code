Writing code did not change much since the early days. 

There are only 3 things that programmers are writing:
- Sequences (aka. Value Assignments)
- Selection (aka. If-Statements)
- and Iterations (aka. Loops)

And there are only three core language variations that modern programming languages leverage:
- Structured
- Object-Oriented
- and Functional

Those core variations of writing code to manipulate the core resulting logic structures of code are currently known atoms of computer science.
