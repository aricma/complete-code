# Planing And Implementing Software

As presented by Robert Martin(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-gF0vDhJVI&list=PLmmYSbUCWJ4x1GO839azG_BBw8rkh-zOj&index=6&t=1413s), Dr. Winston W. Royce wrote a paper on [Managing And Development Of Large Software Systems](https://blog.jbrains.ca/assets/articles/royce1970.pdf) and is concluding that is does not work.
What we should do instead, R. Martin is postulating, that we should do it all in once.

This matches with my experience when developing software projects. The requirements do constantly change. They especially change when the first steps of the projects are done and the end result gets more and more clear.

Should we move into a project agile. Plan, design, and develop a quick first impression and then collect feedback and iterate over?
