# Pragmatic Programming

Dave Tomas wrote a book and gave several talks about how to be a pragmatic programmer.

In 2023 he gave a talk at a GOTO conference(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug8XX2MpzEw). He postulates that all rules and practices in software development are derived from the goal to make software "Easy To Change".
