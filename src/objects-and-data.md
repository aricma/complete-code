# Objects and Data

Object-oriented programming allows for a collection of functions to manipulate local variables or state.
However there is a preferred destinction made between objects and date structures.
Not all functions need state and not all data need to know how to manipulate itself.

Objects where inveted to represent the outside world. Keyboards, the mouse, a printer. Those objects allowed polymorphisim through the implementation of common io interfaces.
There is no state in thoses objects.

**An objects is a stateless representation of an io-device.**

Modern languages also allow for more intuative creation of complex data structures.
The basic building blocks are Primitives, Lists, and Maps.
Data structures are suposed to hold data and not to manipulate data.
