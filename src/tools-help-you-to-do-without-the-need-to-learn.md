# Tools Help You To Do Without The Need To Learn

Resource Talk: https://youtu.be/zNvmjPzdqKc?si=F3aKhx6M_f1EMq0A&t=4879
In this talk Jez Humble is describing how he, in his early days, was working on a project without version control. He and his college where pushing all code directly into production and pulling to merge with local changes.
This sounds terrible in so many ways and dangerous for them and for the business and user depending on that working production code.
But his talk inspired a thought about tools. Jez Humble learned how to make small changes and push working code to production. Not having version control forced him to be intuitively agile and forced him to follow coding best practices of small test driven changes.
If he would not follow the best practices he would fail the production code. The risk and pressure was very high.
Now not using version control is insane of cause especially with larger teams. But a lot of divergent behaviour from best practices comes from tools helping developers not to follow best practices. Tools  help us to be lazy and fast in the short term but we can not run a way from the debt of bad code in the long run.
