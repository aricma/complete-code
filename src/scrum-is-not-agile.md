# Scrum Is Not Agile

Talk about agile with Martin fowler and Dave Thomas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNvmjPzdqKc&list=TLPQMTYwOTIwMjNaXR8us4dQ0A&index=9

## Scrum is a tool
Martin Fowler is saying that for him scrum is a tool and not the reason teams are slow or stuck with near to no output of value.
If you work agile you can use scrum or not that is up to the team and a team might gain by using scrum but they do not work agile by using scrum.

## You can not use Agile you work agile
Dave Thomas is presenting the exploitation of scrum through extemporisation(e.g. consultancy and certification) is not agile.
You can not buy Agile in the sense of the Scrum Certification. Agile is a state and a practice and it has to be learned and practiced for years.

## Scrum is not agile
Robert Martin is always making fun of scrum certification. Simply because Scrum is not Agile. Scrum is a tool that you can use for organisation and for management to track progress but the team still has to make that progress.
You can only progress effectively by following software engineering principles and working agile. Later you can track that progress with scrum.
