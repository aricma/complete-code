Coming to a new project. Reading abandoned code. Working with outdated and/or nor longer supported third party code.

The first thought developer have when confronted with these challenges is to rewrite everything.

Rewriting everything is never the solution. Rewriting everything means the developers give up on basic software development practices.

If you follow basic software development practices you can refactor existing code into the new project requirements.

If the new project requirements do not have any overlap with your existing functionality you can start a new project from scratch you do not *rewrite* what you have because it is a different project.

In case you decide to rewrite anyway you will have to do it fast to get it done. Writing code fast leads to developers writing code that works not code that is easy to change. When the team is done with rewriting we will probably have ended up at the same state as before.
